            Make sure to replace the example data with the actual data you want to insert. If you're using a form to
            gather data, ensure that the content is being sent correctly with your form submission.

            Also, ensure that your create method call in Sequelize includes the content field in the object you're
            passing to it.

            If you're still facing issues, you may want to check for any error messages or logs that might provide more
            details on why the content is not being added.
